It's an attempt to maximize resource exploitation and minimize settler/native conflicts.\n\nThe only issue is with the [NEZ.GetName], who find this proposal to be highly controversial. The tribes are split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but they dont have much leverage in our negotiation. They have again and again asked us to uphold the territories outlined by the Walla Walla Treaty of 1850 and to remove unlawful settlements.

Our tribe is split between accepting and rejecting this proposal, but we dont have much leverage in our negotiation. Chief Hallalhotsoot, the Lawyer Chief, negotiated the original Walla Walla Treaty of 1855. He has navigated politics to give us the best possible deal before, and has manged to secure a small portion of our original territory to stay as our own. The Lawyer Chief states that military conflict with the United States is futile, that it is best to diplomatically secure our existance.\n\nThough not all are agree with the Lawyer Chief's outlook.

The military, on the other hand, demanded that they be moved in 30 days, or the soldiers would use force. General Oliver O.

However, the discovery of gold within the Rocky Mountains brought on a gold rush and a consequent flood of white emigration across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands.\n\nColorado territorial officials are pressuring federal authorities to redefine the extent of Indians treaty lands.

The Cheyenne chiefs were Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little Wolf, Tall Bear, and Left Hand; the Arapaho chiefs were Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, and Big Mouth.\n\nMany Cheyenne claim the signature is illegitimate due to it not being made with a consensus of all tribe members.

Many Cheyennes are opposed to the treaty. That it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts.

Eayre finished his raid on an encampment near Fort Larned, where 240 of his horses and mules were stolen by the Kiowa.

It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.' The grandson thought abut it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, 'Which wolf wins?' The old Cherokee simply replied, 'The one you feed.' There was a low drone as the test plane zipped overhead, and a crackle on the radio of the pilot asking for his next orders. The general gave the go-ahead and moments later the second bomb touched down on the range. There was a crack, and then a flash."

Now, the government is forced to choose between two successors on a short notice. On one side, the effective and efficient but autocratic Annette Taipa Gibson, and on the other the slightly corrupt and certainly profiteering billionare philathropist Adam Wolf's Head."
nativepolitical.7.a:0 "No point endagering the economy, we'll go with the autocrat."

nativemilitary.3.t:0 "The Wendigo Battalion"
nativemilitary.3.d:0 "A wendigo, is an evil spirit which originates from the darkest folklore of this land. The Wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit, sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, which possesses human beings. It is known to invoke feelings of insatiable greed/hunger in men, the desire to cannibalize other humans, as well as the propensity to commit murder in those that fall under its influence. The Wendigo is gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash-gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looks like a skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it has are tattered and bloody ... Unclean and suffering from decay of the flesh, and it gives off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption. This terrible creature stalks in the night, capturing an consuming it's prey, and is truly a figure to be feared. But it's just a myth, right? The truth is, stranger than fiction. These 'wendigo' are not mythical ravenous man-eating monsters, but men, dressed all in black, who hunt in the night. A battalion of soldiers specially trained in the mastery of night-fighting and hunting, and sworn to fight for their people until the very bitter end. These stalkers can track american troops for days, weeks even, calculating their number and understanding their behavior by what they leave behind. They can pull men from their tends, sabotage stores, release horses to run, and cause untold chaos behind enemy lines. Truly, the most feared monster here is in fact man."
nativemilitary.3.a:0 "Well, that's fucking terrifying"

You get S.A.B.R.E. making a three-point entry on your ass. We have a cool acronym, sweet badges, martinis, awesome decryption computers (for 1920), and eyes everywhere."
nativeintelligence.1.a:0 "Suit up."

TAIPA_GIBSON_DESC:0 "Many thought the previous chief was ruthless in his treatment of the Americans, with very few giving any thought to who was feeding him ideas. Annette Taipa Gibson was the reigning crown-princess of terror during the eviction of the USA, and stands ready to show the world that they ain't seen nothing yet. Don't worry, she doesn't bite...much."
WOLFS_HEAD_DESC:0 "Adam Wolf's Head is a very popular man. Former president of the board of shareholders at Sioux Telegraphy, he's a millionare philathropist, businessman, race-car driver, and many other things including the owner of the world's greasiest mosutache. He's also slightly corrupt and highly profiteering, with a copy of Atlas Shrugged instead of morals."
