#Events for appointing the Ottoman grand viziers, if autocracy is in power.
#These are normally triggered every 12 months with the option to keep the curent, but can be activated by decision at a small political power cost.
#Grand viziers were historically changed often - there should be an encouragement for the player to cycle them and a way for the AI to do so.
#If historical AI is on, these events will need to be triggered at the right dates & choose the right viziers

#Events for the deaths of grand viziers if they are in office.
